# futures-await-syn

This crate is a temporary fork of [dtolnay/syn][up]. The `syn` repository
isn't ready for publication yet but we'd like to publish the `futures-await`
crate. This is a temporary fork that will only be maintained for the
`futures-await` crate and it will be unmaintained as soon as `syn` is
published upstream.
